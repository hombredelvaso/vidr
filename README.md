### use

### todo
- figure out all actions in and out of learning elements version... match up to externally control as 'third party plugin'
- move mount element string out of element, and into embed function... add it to the element in the file itself for use in the code

- improve video options: streaming?, non download? Captions.

- BRANCHING: when going from video to video, pass volume and other settings to continue as they are...
- improve branching by adding loop: right now you can go DOWN the tree to terminal nodes like document, but you cannot loop back around [need to have all paths available to decision, and graph like structure to traverse]
- *assistance*: help overlay alongside choice (answer multiple choice or get hint text)
- *devil/angel*: before or after choice you can have video in video... mouse over 2 faces for two differetn advisories, or mouse over heads of board memebers and see what they were thinking
- *state*: if you make someone go below threshold of like, they will answer differently... state matters at certain branches (story-graph)
